# Famfolio Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to the Famfolio Portfolio! This repository contains the project "Famfolio" that my team and I worked on the last 4 weeks of the semester. Famfolio is a project designed to allow users to upload various forms and media and store them. 

## Prerequisites

### create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Team Collaboration

Our team used Trello to manage tasks and collaborate on the "Famfolio" project. I've given the link to the video showcasing what I've accomplished this semester in the comment of my submission.

## My Contribution

I developed the CollectionList component which allowed users to categorize their media how they wanted. This was done by implementing a popup for the user to give a title to their collection. I also designed the sidebar for the colletion list.
